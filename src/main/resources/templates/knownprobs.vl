<h4>Known problems</h4>
<ul>
<li>Authorization should but <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTOR-2128">does not automatically update</a>.  After an hour or so, you'll get an error, and have to logout and log back in.</li>
<li>Calendar data is cached, but the first time loading can be slow, and because I'm avoiding a Javascript framework for now, it's a 90s-era browser experience.</li>
</ul>
