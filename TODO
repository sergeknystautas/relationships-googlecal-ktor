Stuff to do

DEVELOPMENT
- Get a single report calculated
- Get it displayed like the old approach, with some small visual improvements


DEPLOYMENT
- Get this in git
- Get this building from a pipeline in heroku
- Get it working on a heroku pro instance with google auth.


BONUS
- Store sessions in redis instead of local file system (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-redis and https://redislabs.com/lp/redis-java/)
- Use the time zone from the calendar to show everything in that.
- Put calendar time zone next to face.
- Highlight what is a recurring meeting (or if you do with this individual)

FUTURE
? Have it persist the report locally
? Have it able to update a report, so add timestamp of when and change calling, if an existnig one is available.
