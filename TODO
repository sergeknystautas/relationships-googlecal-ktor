Stuff to do

BUGS
These have been moved to https://github.com/sergeknystautas/relationships-googlecal-ktor/issues.

IMPROVEMENTS (make what is there, better)
- Store sessions in redis instead of local file system (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-redis and https://redislabs.com/lp/redis-java/)
- Highlight what is a recurring meeting (or if you do with this individual)
- Cache the calendar data somewhere (redis or mysql?).
x Store when the calendar was last updated, store the sync token, and use that for faster queries to update what is cached.
x Show a report per person to see all of the 1on1s you've had with someone
x Link to a person's profile from their report

ENHANCEMENTS (take this in new directions)
- In discussing the way I use the report, it'd be good to split this report into different sections and give guidance on the why.
- Use the people API/user directory to find your reports.  Show that on the existing report and add a new report to show my reports and manager and if I have recurring events.
- Export reports to Google sheets https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/create#java
