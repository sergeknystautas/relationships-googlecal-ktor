This is the Kotlin rewrite of the one-on-one app report at https://github.com/sergeknystautas/relationships-googlecal.

This is hosted at https://riot-1on1s.herokuapp.com/.  The OAuth account is configured to only allow riotgames.com email addresses as it requires access to calendar and directory information.

The app is still basic and needs to support some better caching and logic, as well as improved logic to identify one-on-ones.  The remaining work and some ideas is in the TODO file.
